Companion repo for "A Taste of Clojure - Intro to Clojure" Mob Programming Sessions 
# A Taste of Clojure 🍒

Welcome to the official exercises for the **A Taste of Clojure: Intro to Clojure Mob Programming Session**. This repo is designed to help experienced developers new to Clojure explore its syntax, REPL workflow, and core concepts through hands-on exercises.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

By the end of this session, you'll be able to:

- Use the REPL to experiment with Clojure interactively
- Read and write basic Clojure syntax (prefix notation, data literals)
- Understand the power of data-driven design and immutability
- Manipulate collections with pure functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Write and compose simple Clojure functions
- Begin to feel the joy of programming in a functional style ✨

## 🛠️ Requirements

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Calva](https://calva.io/)
- Basic command line/git experience
- Comfort with programming in any language (JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/taste-of-clojure-exercises.git
cd taste-of-clojure-exercises
```

2. **Open in VSCode** and make sure Calva is installed.

3. **Start a REPL** via Calva:
   - `Cmd + Shift + P` → "Start REPL and connect"
   - Choose "Create a new project REPL"

4. **Explore `taste-of-clojure/core.clj`**
   - Use the REPL to evaluate each block interactively.
   - Take turns driving if you're in a mob session!

## 🧪 Exercises Included

- **REPL Warmup**: Simple expressions and function definitions
- **Data Manipulation**: Playing with vectors and maps
- **Mini Project**: Build a simple TODO list tracker
- **Bonus**: Manipulating nested data structures

## 👥 Mob Programming Tips

- Rotate every 5–10 minutes
- Use the driver/navigator pairing
- Be curious and kind — Clojure is different, and that’s the point!
